  "description": "A company performs $10,000 of consulting work in December but receives cash payment in January. Under accrual accounting, how much revenue is recognized in December?",
  "answer": 10000,
  "unit": "$",
  "hint": "Revenue is recognized when work is performed, not when cash is received.",
  "explanation": "Revenue is recognized in December because that’s when the work was performed. Cash basis would recognize it in January. Accrual basis = performance period.",

  "learnContent": {
    "coreConcept": "Accrual = when work is done; Cash = when payment is received.",
    "howItWorks": "If service is performed, it's accrual revenue. Cash received later shows up in CFO.",
    "whyItMatters": "This affects the income statement vs. cash flow timing. Common modeling point in interviews.",
    "formula": "Revenue recognized = Services performed (under accrual)"
